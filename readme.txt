======================================
The Stupla module for Moodle 2.7 - 2.9
======================================

    The Studierplatz2000-Module enables the teacher to embed a Studierplatz(-Environment) into Moodle so that it can benefit from

    - storing / restoring user data
    - evaluate using statistics
    - user administration / access restriction

    Studierplatz(2000) is a web based learning-environment, that can be used standalone offline within a browser. Additionally it
    can be connected to a (backend) webserver (oo similar), that stores the the user data centralised and allows evaluation/export
    of the collected data.
    This Studierplatz2000-Module is a kind of adaptor to use Moodle as such a backend.
     
    Further information about Studierplatz can be found under http://studierplatz2000.tu-dresden.de.
